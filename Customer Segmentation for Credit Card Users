Credit Card Customer Segmentation Using K-means and Hierarchical Clustering #
This project segments credit card customers based on their spending and credit usage patterns. Using data on purchases, cash advances, credit limits, payments, and balance frequency, we applied hierarchical and K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. The insights drawn from this analysis can help tailor marketing strategies, customer retention initiatives, and personalized offers.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Initial analysis to understand the data structure, detect missing values, and identify outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and preparing for clustering.
Hierarchical Clustering: Visualization of clusters formed using PURCHASES and CREDIT_LIMIT, showing inherent groupings in the data.
K-means Clustering: The optimal number of clusters identified with the elbow method, followed by a PCA-based visualization of K-means clusters.
Interpretation: Insights into customer segments and their potential use for targeted marketing.
Repository Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for clustering analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization.
plots/: Saved cluster visualizations for both hierarchical and K-means clustering.
